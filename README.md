# AirBnB_clone_v2
Project Title: Python-based Console for Object Management in AirBnB Clone

Project Overview üè†

This initiative aims to develop a robust command-line interface (CLI) for managing objects within the data model of an AirBnB clone. The focus is on creating, modifying, and deleting objects within a sandboxed environment. Presently, the project exclusively encompasses the backend console functionality. The ultimate goal is to produce a comprehensive web application that seamlessly integrates database storage and front-end interfacing, mirroring the features of AirBnB.

Key Components and Features:

Console/Command Interpreter:

Implementation of a user-friendly CLI to facilitate the creation, modification, and deletion of objects within the AirBnB clone's data model.
A sandboxed environment to ensure secure and controlled operations through the console.
Data Model:

Definition and structuring of the data model to accurately represent the entities and relationships in the AirBnB clone.
Object-oriented design for efficient handling of data structures and relationships.
Object Management:

Comprehensive functionality for managing objects, including the ability to create, modify, and delete entities within the data model.
Error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and system stability.
File Storage Conversion:

Integration of mechanisms to convert the data model to a JSON file for persistent storage.
Efficient serialization and deserialization processes to facilitate seamless interaction with the file storage.
Programming Language:

Utilization of Python for the development of the entire project, ensuring code readability, maintainability, and a robust development environment.

Classes üÜë

AirBnB utilizes the following classes:

BaseModel   FileStorage User    State   City    Amenity Place   Review
PUBLIC INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES  id
created_at
updated_at      Inherits from BaseModel Inherits from BaseModel Inherits from BaseModel Inherits from BaseModel Inherits from BaseModel Inherits from BaseModel
PUBLIC INSTANCE METHODS save
to_dict all
new
save
reload  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""  ""
PUBLIC INSTANCE METHODS         emailbrpassword
first_name
last_name   name    state_id
name    name    city_id
user_idbrname
description
number_bathrooms
price_by_night
latitude
longitude
amenity_ids place_id
user_id
text
PRIVATE CLASS ATTRIBUTES        file_path
objects             

Storage üõÑ

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the FileStorage class.

Every time the backend is initialized, AirBnB instantiates an instance of FileStorage called Storage. The storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file file.json. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the storage object is used to register corresponding chnages in the file.json.

Console üíª

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of AirBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).

Using the Console

The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the file console.py by itself:

$ ./console.py
While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) 
To quit the console, enter the command quit, or input an EOF signal (ctrl-D).

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$


1. First clone this repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
4. When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
5. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands
    * create - Creates an instance based on given class

    * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

    * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)


##### Alternative Syntax
Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

	Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

	* count - Return number of object instances by class

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

	* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID
